# LinkForge

LinkForge is a link-in-bio platform where users can create a public profile page and organize links into cards and collections.

This workspace currently contains the backend. The frontend is planned separately and is documented here so both sides stay aligned.

---

## Product Overview

- Users sign up, log in, and manage their content from an authenticated dashboard
- Each user has a public profile page identified by username
- Content is organized into cards
- Each card can contain top-level links and collections
- Collections can contain ordered links

---

## Frontend

### Frontend Goals

- Provide auth screens for sign up and login
- Provide a dashboard for managing cards, links, collections, and profile settings
- Provide a public profile page for visitors
- Support drag-and-drop ordering for top-level card items and links inside collections

### Planned Frontend Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|------|------------|
| Framework | Next.js (App Router) |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS |
| State / Data | API client + auth helpers |
| Deployment | Vercel |

### Planned Frontend Pages

| Route | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `/register` | Sign-up form |
| `/login` | Login form |
| `/dashboard` | Main editor for cards, links, and collections |
| `/dashboard/appearance` | Profile and theme settings |
| `/u/:username` | Public-facing profile page |

### Backend Auth Notes

- Access tokens are used on protected API requests
- Refresh tokens are used to obtain a new token pair
- Protected routes resolve the current user from the access token subject
- Logout and server-side token revocation are not implemented yet

---

## Shared Product Features

### Current Core Scope

- Auth with access and refresh tokens
- Public profile retrieval by username
- Profile editing for authenticated users
- Card CRUD
- Collection CRUD
- Link CRUD
- Reordering of mixed top-level card items
- Reordering of links inside collections

### Later / Extended Scope

- Richer theme presets and custom themes
- Link click analytics
- Social icon detection from URLs
- QR code generation
- Custom domains
- Avatar upload pipeline

---

## Development Notes

- The backend now uses Alembic for schema migrations
- The app should not create tables automatically on import
- Ordered content is driven by `position` for links and collections
- Card order is currently deterministic but not user-reorderable
- The frontend should treat the backend API contract above as the source of truth, not older route names like `/auth/register`
